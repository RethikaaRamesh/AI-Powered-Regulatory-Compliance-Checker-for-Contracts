        "## System Description\n",
        "The system uses Python for processing contract text and decision-making,\n",
        "and SQLite (SQL) for storing contracts, clauses, risks, regulatory\n",
        "updates, and notifications. The integration of Python and SQL allows the\n",
        "program to simulate an intelligent contract compliance system.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Working Principle\n",
        "The program follows these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Database Connection and Table Creation**  \n",
        "   The system connects to an SQLite database and creates tables to store:\n",
        "   - Contracts  \n",
        "   - Regulatory clauses  \n",
        "   - Compliance risks  \n",
        "   - Regulatory updates  \n",
        "   - Notifications  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Insertion**  \n",
        "   Sample contract data and regulatory clauses are inserted into the\n",
        "   database for demonstration purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Clause Identification**  \n",
        "   The contract text is retrieved from the database and checked against\n",
        "   a list of required clauses (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).  \n",
        "   Clauses found in the contract are marked as present, and missing\n",
        "   clauses are identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Risk Analysis**  \n",
        "   The number of missing clauses is used to determine the risk level:\n",
        "   - Low Risk: No missing clauses  \n",
        "   - Medium Risk: One missing clause  \n",
        "   - High Risk: More than one missing clause  \n",
        "\n",
        "   The missing clauses and risk level are stored in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Regulatory Update Tracking**  \n",
        "   The system retrieves and displays regulatory updates stored in the\n",
        "   database to simulate monitoring of changes in laws and regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Contract Modification Suggestions**  \n",
        "   For each missing clause, the system generates a suggested contract\n",
        "   clause using predefined templates. These suggestions help in making\n",
        "   the contract compliant with regulatory requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Notification Generation**  \n",
        "   A compliance alert message is created based on the risk level and\n",
        "   missing clauses. The alert is stored in the database and displayed as\n",
        "   a simulated email or Slack notification.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Final Compliance Report**  \n",
        "   The system displays:\n",
        "   - Compliance risks stored in the database  \n",
        "   - Notification logs  \n",
        "\n",
        "   This provides a complete summary of the contract’s compliance status.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Database Structure\n",
        "The following tables are used in the system:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **contracts** – stores contract text  \n",
        "- **clauses** – stores regulatory clause names  \n",
        "- **compliance_risks** – stores missing clauses and risk level  \n",
        "- **regulatory_updates** – stores law update information  \n",
        "- **notifications** – stores compliance alert messages  \n",
        "\n",
        "This structure supports clause detection, risk analysis, regulatory\n",
        "tracking, contract modification, and notification generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technologies Used\n",
        "- Python for program logic and text processing  \n",
        "- SQLite (SQL) for database storage and queries  \n",
        "- String matching for clause detection  \n",
        "- Database integration using the sqlite3 library  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "This integrated Python and SQL system demonstrates how contract\n",
        "compliance checking can be automated. The system reduces manual review\n",
        "effort by automatically identifying missing regulatory clauses,\n",
        "assessing compliance risk, and generating alerts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system can be extended in the future using advanced Natural Language\n",
        "Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT\n",
        "or LLaMA for more accurate clause extraction and legal interpretation."
